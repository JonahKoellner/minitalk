Also possible with reallocation and join but I already did that in get_next_line, 
so I wanted to try something new.

Improvements:

Theory:
    First thing send is the amount of incoming characters.
    Then a 0
    Then all the characters
    Then a 0

0 always means "done with current task / part"


Functions:
    - Detect if true number, for checking input from user
    - Depends on how to solve the problem, but propably realloc and join






How to break possibly every minitalk:
./client 94886 "hallo" & ./client 94886 "test"
Does this need to be handled ?
